## Builiding Apps and Little Projects 

Imperative thinking: 
you tell your UI what to do with the logic of the data/ 
something changes you update.
the UI and logic need to be in sync

We declare the rules for our UI upfront, s when we change the data the UI behaviors conform 

everytime we add a modifier we are wrapping it around another modifier, 

if youa re using specif modifer you nedd ot put them right after the modifier they are related to. 

what is a viewbuilder ??
